### This repository describes how a Python script started the AutoML job on Azure ML Studio, fetched an industrial dataset from Azure ML Data Stores, and started computation. The script enables the creation of a pipeline on AutoML, training a Machine Learning model, and downloading the artifacts. The artifacts include model.pkl, the conda environment, and the requirements.txt file. Used ONNX tools and libraries to convert the model.pkl into ONNX format for the deployment of the model onto an industrial edge device
